# POptimize

Parallel/distributed optimization framework for the Elixir programming language. Main aim is to explore how parallel and distributed computation can be used from the ground up in an optimization framework. It is expected that there will be many gains to this as we get even more cores and can utilize more and more computers for distributed computing.

## Optimality

The library supports many different types of optimality:

- Pareto optimality
- epsilon Pareto optimality

and more will be added:

- Geoffrion Pareto optimality
